# 151AGroupProject

Overview of Data: 
Data can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/airbnb-listings-reviews). We are using the 'Listings.csv' data and the corresponding 'Listings_data_dictionary.csv', which is just a dictionary describing all the fields in Listings.csv. 

This dataset uses a public domain license described here: [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Based on this license, we are free to copy, modify, distribute and perform the work without asking permission. 

Objective: We are building a model to predict an Airbnb's review rating based on other factors.  

## Data Exploration and Initial Preprocessing (Milestone 2)

The initial data preprocessing and exploration is done in [project.ipynb](https://github.com/BrianMorse12604/151AGroupProject/blob/main/project.ipynb), linked in this github.

#### Data Preprocessing Steps:
The raw data has 279712 rows and 33 fields (columns), with 12 of these fields containing missing values. 

1. After looking through each field and its description, we dropped every column that could not be used to predict the review scores (target feature is 'review_scores_rating' which is an overall review rating): 'review_scores_accuracy', 'review_scores_cleanliness', 'review_scores_checkin', 'review_scores_communication', 'review_scores_location', 'review_scores_value'. We also dropped irrelevant columns: 'listing_id', 'name', 'host_id'.
2. Many of the host columns had the same number of missing values, and we confirmed that this meant the Airbnb didn't have information on those hosts (as many of the rows had missing values for all the columns 'host_since', 'host_is_superhost', 'host_total_listings_count', "host_has_profile_pic", "host_identity_verified"). We deleted all the rows in which the Airbnb did not have information on the host, as well as the columns that had too many missing values: host response times, host response rates, district, 
3. Many rows had missing values for the number of bedrooms, and it was a tough decision but ultimately we opted to drop all rows where the number of bedrooms was missing, considering that it'd be tough to make a decision on booking an AirBNB without its number of bedrooms.
4. We decided latitude and longitude would be redundant when city is already provided, so we dropped that variable. We'll also drop neighborhood, as we feel it's unlikely to have enough data points for each neighborhood to be of use. We'll also drop host_location, as we don't see it being effective in predicting rating.
5. Finally, we're also going to have to drop all rows where review_scores_rating is null, as this is the variable we need to predict.

After this process, our data has 168414 entries with 16 fields. This preserved 60% of the observations. The following is a breakdown of the key columns we chose to keep, and the rational behind keeping them: 

- host_since -- we want the amount of time a host has been active, as we think this would've given them time to adjust their properties to be of higher quality. We converted this into number of days the host has been active.
- All other host variables -- gives us a decent idea of the quality of the host.
- city -- gives us a good idea of their rough location.
- property_type and room_type -- the type of housing may affect how well they're generally rated
- accomodates / bedrooms -- the size of the AirBNB might follow general trends in rating
- amenities -- gives us the added benefits, which may add a convenience that'll boost rating.
- price -- rating may be correlated with pricing, one way or another. The price is initially listed in the Airbnb's local price, which we converted to USD to be consistent across the entire data.
- minimum_nights and maximum_nights -- we think that this'll add to or subtract from the convenience for the user, leading to correlation with rating
- instant_bookable -- same as above.

To ensure only numerical data: All the columns that have t/f, we converted to binary 1/0. All columns with categorical variables, with the exception of amenities, we one-hot encoded. This is "property_type", "room_type", "city". We only included the top 100 amenities. 

#### Normalizing the Data
(if you change how we normalized the data, please update this portion)
From a boxplot of the nonbinary features, we found that features such as 'host_total_listings_count,' 'price,' 'minimum_nights,' and 'maximum_nights' have extreme outliers that we can drop. We will drop the first 10 outliers of the previously notable features mentioned. We have opted not to employ the IQR method since it would excessively constrain our dataset.

After dropping these outliers, we normalized the data.
